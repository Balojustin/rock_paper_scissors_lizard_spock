# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
### By Folami

## Background
If you are a nerd like me and also a movie fan, then you probably have seen 'The big bang theory' and [Jim Parson's Genius work explaining this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Q6-wMx-K8). "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" was created by internet pioneer: Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game which has a limited number of outcomes - All hail Sam Kass.

## How it works
It is a Player vs Computer game. Player enters one of 5 inputs and computer also chooses one of the five available options. The winner is determined based on the relationship web described below:
Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaprizes Rock, Rock crushes Scissors.
